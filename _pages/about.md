I'm a graduate student in the Data Science Program at Bellevue University (expected completion: June 2021). I'm an aspiring Data Analyst, experienced with Python, SQL, and R programming. I work on the Business Operations side of entertainment distributions but am open to finding work in the Environmental and Sustainability field.
